        I'm Maxim Nosov, student of Seneca College, my program is 'CPA', which stands for Computer
        Programming & Analysis , currently on my 2nd semester. I Live in Russia, in a very cold
        place on earth, in Siberia. I work hard to learn high-level languages, such as C++,
        JavaScript, etc. to write meaningful programs. I'm so much into programming and spend most
        of time in front of computer. In my free time I play video games(as any student I guess), or
        do some sports, like push-ups, pull-ups, or do plank. For this website I applied my
        knowledges of HTML and a little bit of CSS.

        I chose the eastern chipmunk, because it's the cutest animal that I ever seen. Also, I met
        some of them in my country. I created this website in order to give other students an
        opportunity to learn more about this amazing creature.
